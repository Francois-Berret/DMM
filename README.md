Project carried out by me and two collaborators in 10 days to validate the 'Direction of data management projects' block of the RNCP level 7 certification "Designer - developer in data science"

This project involves creating a functional online application aimed at addressing the following issue: the data job market is rapidly expanding, resulting in a proliferation of job titles that can sometimes be obscure or greatly divergent from the actual responsibilities associated with the position. This can make it challenging to effectively search for data-related jobs, and candidates may miss out on employment opportunities due to lack of clarity in job listings. The purpose of this application is to provide greater visibility into the current data job market, including the most sought-after roles, desired skills, geographic areas, and companies with the highest recruitment activity. Most importantly, this application utilizes artificial intelligence to group in specific clusters job postings from major job listing websites based solely on their detailed descriptions, thereby avoiding the bias introduced by ambiguous or inappropriate job titles.

The process of developing this application required several steps, including scraping, data processing, machine learning, dashboard creation, application development, and deployment. All documents and codes related to these different steps can be found in this folder.


⚠️ Important information: The job offers contained in the application were obtained from the Indeed, HelloWork, Welcome to the Jungle and LinkedIn sites for a past given day and have not been updated in any way
